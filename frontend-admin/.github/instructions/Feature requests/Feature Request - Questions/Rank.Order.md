# Rank Order Question

1. **Structure**
    - **Visual Elements:** A list of items that the respondent needs to rank in order. Depending on the format, this could look like a drag-and-drop list, a set of dropdowns or text fields next to each item, or a matrix of radio buttons for ranking positions. The goal is to capture an ordinal preference for each item relative to the others.
    - **Variations:** Four format options under *Rank Order*:
        - *Drag and Drop:* Items are displayed as a list that respondents can click and drag into the desired order. This interactive format is intuitive for shorter lists. (On mobile devices, this may allow tapping and moving items up/down.)
        - *Radio Buttons:* Items are listed in rows, and each possible rank number (1, 2, 3, etc.) is a column with a radio button. The respondent selects a rank for each item, typically ensuring only one item per rank (Qualtrics will enforce one selection per column in this format).
        - *Text Box:* Items are listed, and each item has a blank text field next to it. The respondent must type a rank number into each box (e.g., type “1” for the highest priority item, “2” for the next, and so on). You can choose to require all items be ranked or a subset.
        - *Select Box:* Items are in a list on the left, and the interface provides “Move Up/Down” arrows or a dual-list interface. The respondent selects an item and uses arrows to reorder the list (or selects from one list to another). This is an alternative for when drag-and-drop might be cumbersome, especially with longer lists.
    - Each format allows the respondent to produce a full ranking of the items, though the interaction style differs. (The Drag & Drop is the only format compatible with the new mobile experience by default, per Qualtrics notes.)
2. **Settings & Features**
    - **Validation:** Under *Response Requirements*, you can add rules:
        - *Must Rank All:* The respondent must assign a rank to every item (no item can be left unranked). This option is available for all formats except Drag & Drop (Drag & Drop inherently requires placing all items in order).
        - *Must Rank Between X and Y:* The respondent must rank at least a minimum number of items and at most a maximum number. You define the range of how many items need to be ranked. (Not available for Drag & Drop or Select Box, since those typically assume ranking all items; it’s mainly for Text Box and Radio formats where perhaps not every item needs a rank.)
        - *Custom Validation:* You can create a custom rule, for example requiring certain items to have higher rank than others, etc., though this is rarely used.
      Additionally, aside from these, a **Force Response** can be applied (except in the Select Box format, which doesn’t support Force Response directly). Force Response on Drag & Drop essentially means the question cannot be skipped (Drag & Drop always expects all items to be ordered if answered at all).
    - **Display Options:** 
        - You can randomize the order of the items when initially displayed, to avoid bias (especially important in ranking tasks so that items aren’t always in a logical order to start with).
        - For the *Text Box* format, you can choose alignment of the input boxes (vertical stack vs horizontal alignment with the list).
        - In *Select Box* format, you might have options to change the prompt text or how the arrows are labeled, but the main display is fixed.
        - You can add *drag handles* icon in Drag & Drop format (Qualtrics usually shows a grip icon automatically). 
        - **Option grouping:** If you have many items, sometimes splitting them into groups for ranking isn’t supported directly (ranking is typically one list). If needed, you’d use multiple rank order questions.
        - By default, Qualtrics will not let a respondent assign the same rank to two different items in Radio Button or Text Box formats. It will warn if there’s a duplicate or missing rank.
    - **Logic Support:** Rank Order results can be used in logic, though you have to be mindful of how the data is stored. Each item’s rank can be evaluated. For example, you can set Branch Logic such as “If [Rank Order Question] – [Item A] = 1 (ranked 1st) then …”. Internally, Qualtrics treats each item’s rank as a separate value (column), so conditions can target those. You could also use logic like “If Item X’s rank is less than or equal to 3” (meaning it was ranked in the top 3). Display Logic can also show/hide subsequent questions based on ranks (e.g., “ask why you chose X as #1” if a certain item was ranked first).
3. **Data Export Schema**
    - **CSV Column Header Format:** Each item being ranked in the question will have its own column in the exported data. The column header typically includes the question text or number and the item text. For example, if the question is Q1 and one of the items is “Option A,” you might see a header like “Q1 – Option A (Rank)”.
    - **Data Values:** For each respondent, the value in each item’s column is the numeric rank assigned to that item. For instance, if “Option A” was ranked 3rd by the respondent, the cell under Option A’s column will contain “3”. If an item was not ranked (e.g., if validation allowed leaving some items unranked or the respondent skipped the question entirely), that cell might be blank. In Drag & Drop format, since respondents must order all, every item will have a rank value. If the question was skipped entirely, all items’ columns would be blank for that respondent.
    - **Recode Values:** Rank Order doesn’t use “recode values” in the same way a multiple-choice does because the output is an actual entered rank number. The items themselves aren’t “coded” by Qualtrics beyond their position. (There’s no option to recode 1 into something else; 1 means 1st rank inherently.) One thing to note: If you have more items than ranks required (say “Must Rank top 3 out of 10”), unranked items might sometimes get a default code in data exports (Qualtrics usually leaves them blank). But typically, **each item’s rank is exactly the number the respondent gave it**. These values are not editable via recode settings in the survey editor. If you need to reverse the scale (e.g., treat 1 as lowest in analysis), that has to be done outside Qualtrics.
