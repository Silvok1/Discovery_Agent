# Heat Map Question

1. **Structure**
    - **Visual Elements:** An image on which respondents can click anywhere (not limited to preset regions). Each click they make drops a marker (usually a small dot) on that location. Unlike Hot Spot, which has defined areas, Heat Map allows free-form clicking. It is used to identify areas of interest or concern on an image without pre-highlighting specific regions.
    - **Interaction:** You can allow a single click or multiple clicks:
        - The setting “Clicks allowed” (Interaction) lets you specify how many distinct points a respondent can mark on the image. The default is 1 (one click). If you set it to, say, 3, the respondent can place up to 3 dots on the image.
        - If a respondent clicks more times than allowed, the earliest click will typically disappear or be replaced. Qualtrics handles this by either preventing extra clicks or replacing the oldest click with the new one (so the total number of active markers never exceeds the limit).
    - **Regions (for analysis):** You can (optionally) draw invisible regions on the image in the Heat Map setup. These do not affect what respondents can do (they can still click anywhere), but these “analysis regions” will bucket the clicks in the data or reporting. For example, you might define a region covering a certain area so later you can easily count how many clicks fell into that area versus outside. Respondents do not see these regions or get any indication of them.
    - **Use Cases:** Common for user experience or design tests, e.g., “Click on the part of the webpage that you first look at” or “Click on areas you find confusing.” In reporting, a heat map visualization can be generated to show concentration of clicks.
2. **Settings & Features**
    - **Clicks Allowed:** Set the number of clicks a respondent can make (from 1 up to perhaps 10 – Qualtrics typically allows up to maybe 10, but large numbers of clicks can be hard to analyze). If you allow multiple clicks, respondents can usually also deselect a placed dot by clicking it again (depending on the interface; generally a second click on the same spot might remove it or they might have to have an undo).
    - **Add Graphic:** Upload the image that will serve as the background for the heat map. Make sure the image is clear and sized appropriately (the coordinate data recorded is relative to the image’s pixel dimensions).
    - **Add Region (for reporting):** As mentioned, you can define regions after setting the image. This is done similarly to Hot Spot: click “Add Region” and draw a rectangle (or custom shape by editing points) over an area of interest. Name these regions. They are only used in data output and certain widgets (like to count clicks per region). *Important:* If no regions are added, the data will just be raw coordinates; if regions are added, Qualtrics will also output which region was clicked (if any).
    - **Interaction Constraints:** You might not have a “Min/Max” validation for number of clicks beyond the fixed number allowed. If you want to force at least one click, just use Force Response (so they can’t skip without clicking). If you allow up to N clicks, respondents may choose to use fewer than N; that is typically acceptable unless you specifically require they use all available clicks (Qualtrics doesn’t naturally enforce using all allowed clicks).
    - **Mobile Consideration:** On mobile, tapping on an image will place a dot as well. The Heat Map question is not available in the new mobile-optimized survey experience (Qualtrics notes that certain question types, including Heat Map, only work in the legacy survey experience).
    - **Logic Support:** 
        - Branch logic can use whether a click was inside a defined region. Specifically, if you have regions, you can set conditions like “If Region X was clicked” or even “If number of clicks in Region Y ≥ 1”. Without defined regions, using logic is trickier because you’d have to use coordinates (which is not straightforward – Qualtrics doesn’t directly allow “if click X coordinate > some value” in the logic builder).
        - Piped text could theoretically pipe the coordinates of clicks or the name of a region clicked. For example, you might capture the X,Y of the click via piped text (Qualtrics has a piping code for the coordinates of a specific click).
        - Usually, analysis of heat map data (especially with multiple clicks) is done after data collection rather than mid-survey logic.
3. **Data Export Schema**
    - **CSV Column Header Format:** For each allowed click, two columns are provided: one for the X-coordinate and one for the Y-coordinate of that click. Coordinates are measured in pixels from the top-left of the image. For example, if one click is allowed, you might see columns labeled something like “Q2_1_x” and “Q2_1_y” (meaning the X and Y coordinate of Click 1 on Q2). If up to three clicks are allowed, you’d have “Q2_1_x, Q2_1_y, Q2_2_x, Q2_2_y, Q2_3_x, Q2_3_y”.
        - If you added regions for analysis, an additional column is included per click indicating the region name (or ID) that the click fell into (or “Other/None” if the click was outside all defined regions). This might be labeled like “Q2_1_region” for the first click’s region.
    - **Data Values:** 
        - X and Y columns: contain numeric pixel values. For example, X=150, Y=300 means the respondent clicked 150 pixels from the left edge and 300 pixels from the top edge of the image.
        - Region column (if present): contains the name of the region in which the click occurred. If a click doesn’t fall into any defined region, Qualtrics will label it “Other” (as a default category for outside any region). If exporting numeric values instead of labels, region might be coded (perhaps by an index or regionID), but typically one would export labels to get region names.
        - If a respondent did not use all allowed clicks, unused click columns may be blank (for instance, if 3 clicks allowed but respondent only clicked twice, the third X and Y would be blank). If the question was skipped entirely, all columns for that question are blank.
    - **Recode Values:** Not much recoding applicable:
        - The coordinates are raw numbers and can’t be “recoded” in Qualtrics (other than perhaps scaling if the image was resized, but Qualtrics handles that automatically by reference to original image dimensions).
        - The region names are as defined. You cannot assign numeric codes to regions within the survey editor; they are textual labels. If you export numeric data, Qualtrics might enumerate regions in order of creation (e.g., region 1, 2, 3) and use those numbers in the region column, but typically one uses labels for clarity.
        - Essentially, no manual recoding is done on Heat Map outputs – you interpret coordinates directly, and region mapping is just a convenience for analysis. If needed, you could post-process to categorize coordinates into custom areas, but that’s outside Qualtrics.
      - *Important limit:* Qualtrics reports and dashboards can only handle up to 50 heat map questions; beyond that, they won't all display internally (though data would still export). This just informs that heat map is a heavy data question type.
