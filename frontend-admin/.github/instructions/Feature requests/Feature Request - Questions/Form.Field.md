# Form Field Question

1. **Structure**
    - **Visual Elements:** A composite question containing multiple text entry fields grouped together (often used for collecting contact information or other related fields in one question). Each field has its own label (e.g., Name, Email, Address, etc.) and a text box for the respondent to fill in.
    - **Variations:** You can customize the number of fields. By default, you might start with a couple (like “First Name”, “Last Name”) but you can add as many as needed. Qualtrics provides a *Suggested Form Fields* option (currently an “Address” template) that, when used, automatically creates common address fields (e.g., Street, City, State, Postal Code, Country). You can also manually define each field’s label. The fields are usually displayed one per line (stacked vertically), but layout might adjust slightly based on theme/mobile.
2. **Settings & Features**
    - **Validation:** Each field in the form can have its own *Content Validation*. For example, you can set the email field to “Email Address” validation so it expects an “@” format, or a ZIP code field to accept a 5-digit number, etc. This is done by clicking “Click to edit validation” above the form fields and setting each field’s type and/or length requirements. You can also mark specific fields (or all fields) as required. (The “Force Response” setting on the overall question will typically require every field to be filled; additionally, you have the *Response Requirements* option “Force Response” on each text field in the form as described.) Field sizes (length of the text box) can be set to Short, Medium, Long, or Essay to visually indicate expected answer length.
    - **Display Options:** You can easily add or remove fields. The form editing pane allows quick entry of multiple field names (each line you enter becomes a field label). You can drag fields up/down to reorder them. All fields are part of one question, so they share the same question number and descriptive text (if any). On the survey, the form will appear as a list of labeled text boxes. Spacing and layout are mostly handled by the theme (with possibly two columns if using “Address” suggested fields on wide screens, but generally it’s one column of fields). Note that on the New Survey Engine, the exact layout or style might differ slightly (as noted by a Qtip in the documentation about field appearance).
    - **Logic Support:** Each field’s input can be referenced in logic by specifying the form question and the particular field. For instance, you could set Branch Logic like “If [Form Question] – [Email Address] is not empty AND [Form Question] – [Email Address] contains ‘@domain.com’ then…”. Display Logic cannot target individual fields (since they are part of one question), but you can use Skip Logic or Branch conditions based on what was entered in a specific form field. Also, you might pipe individual form field values into later questions or messages (e.g., “Thank you, ${q://QID12/Field_2} for providing your email.”).
3. **Data Export Schema**
    - **CSV Column Header Format:** Each form field becomes its own column in the exported data. The column header will include the question and field identifier. By default, Qualtrics uses the question number/ID and the field’s position or name (e.g., the export header might be “QID12_1” for the first field, “QID12_2” for the second, etc., or it could use the Field Label if exporting with choice text as header). If you use the “Address” suggested fields, the columns might be named accordingly (e.g., “Q5 – Street Address”, “Q5 – City”, etc., in a labels export).
    - **Data Values:** Each column contains the text the respondent entered for that field. If a respondent leaves a particular form field blank, that cell will be blank in the data. All values are treated as strings (even if they look like numbers, they are not automatically numeric since they are open text inputs).
    - **Recode Values:** Not applicable. Form fields collect open-ended text, so there are no numeric recodes for the responses. (Any validation you set – e.g., numeric only – does not change the fact that the stored data is the literal entered text. It just restricts what can be entered.)
