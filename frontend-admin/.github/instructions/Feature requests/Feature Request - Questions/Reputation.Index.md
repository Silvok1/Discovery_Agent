# Net Promoter Score® (NPS) Question

1. **Structure**
    - **Visual Elements:** A specialized single-select question displayed as an 11-point scale from 0 to 10. Typically, the question text is standardized (e.g., “On a scale from 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend our company to a friend or colleague?”). The scale is usually shown horizontally with labels at the ends such as “Not at all likely” (at 0) and “Extremely likely” (at 10).
    - **Variations:** The NPS question format is fixed to 0–10. You have limited variations:
        - You may toggle **labels** on the scale: by default Qualtrics includes two labels (“Not at all likely” at 0 and “Extremely likely” at 10). You can add a third midpoint label or remove labels entirely, but the scale points remain 0 through 10.
        - The question is often presented in a horizontal layout. On small screens (mobile), Qualtrics might automatically switch it to a horizontal slider or a vertical stack for better display (especially in the New Survey Taking Experience, horizontal is default on mobile but can be adjusted in Look & Feel if needed).
        - No other subtypes (NPS is a standardized question type by itself).
2. **Settings & Features**
    - **Validation:** Generally, you can apply Force Response or Request Response to require an answer, but there is no other special validation because the answer must simply be one of the 0–10 options. Since NPS is one question, it’s either answered with one selection or left blank (if not forced).
    - **Display Options:** Customization is intentionally limited to maintain standardization. You can edit the wording of the question prompt (especially to insert your company or product name). You can choose whether to show the two default anchor labels or include up to 3 labels on the scale. The question’s appearance (buttons or radio slider) is governed by the theme; some themes might show NPS as a row of radio buttons or as an interactive slider. There is an implicit category grouping of responses (0–6, 7–8, 9–10), but on the survey itself only the numbers (and any labels you provided) are shown to respondents.
    - **Logic Support:** NPS responses are numeric (0 through 10), so they can be used in Skip Logic or Branch Logic like any numeric single-choice response. For example, you can branch if the NPS score is less than 7 (Detractor), between 7 and 8 (Passive), or 9 or above (Promoter). Qualtrics also often provides built-in reporting for NPS (it will calculate the NPS score = %Promoters minus %Detractors). You can pipe the selected number into later questions or messages if needed (e.g., “You gave us a ${q://QID##/ChoiceGroup/SelectedChoices} on the recommend scale.”).
3. **Data Export Schema**
    - **CSV Column Header Format:** The NPS question exports typically as one question in the dataset. Qualtrics will include the result in one or two related columns. In many cases, you will see one column for the numeric score and another for the NPS category (Promoter/Passive/Detractor). The exact header names might append something like “(group)” for the category column. (For example, you might have “Q15” for the score and “Q15_GROUP” for the category in the raw data.)
    - **Data Values:** The primary value is the selected score 0–10 (as a number). Additionally, Qualtrics will determine the NPS group:
        - If exporting **labels**, you may see the group label (e.g., “Detractor”, “Passive”, or “Promoter”) either in a separate column or combined. Typically, it’s provided in a separate column for convenience.
        - If exporting **values**, the score column will have the number (0–10). The group column may also be numeric or text; Qualtrics might code Detractors/Passives/Promoters as 0/1/2 or similar internally, but usually it’s safest to use the labeled output for group.
        - Example: A respondent who answered “7” would have a 7 in the score column and “Passive” in the group column.
    - **Recode Values:** The scale values 0 through 10 are fixed and generally should not be recoded (Qualtrics does not allow changing the underlying 0–10 values for an NPS question, to preserve the standard calculation). The group categorization is derived from the score: 0–6 = Detractor, 7–8 = Passive, 9–10 = Promoter. Those group designations are hard-coded. Thus, there is no user-adjustable recode for the NPS scale points, and the exported values will reflect the standard scheme.
