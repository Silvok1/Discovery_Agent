# Slider Question

1. **Structure**
    - **Visual Elements:** One or more interactive slider bars allowing respondents to indicate a numeric value by dragging a handle. Each slider typically has a scale (minimum to maximum value). Sliders are often presented with a question or statement (which can serve as the label for the slider or as a row header if multiple sliders are listed).
    - **Variations:** There are three slider styles:
        - *Bars:* A rectangular bar that fills in as you drag (visually indicating the level).
        - *Sliders:* A traditional line with a handle that you slide (functionally similar to bars; the naming in the interface distinguishes the look).
        - *Stars:* A star rating interface (usually 5 stars by default) where clicking sets a star rating. Stars have special interaction settings (see below).
      Additionally, you can have **multiple statements** in a Slider question (each statement will have its own slider or star row – effectively a matrix of sliders with one column).
      - For **Stars** specifically, Interaction options include:
          - *Discrete:* only whole stars can be selected.
          - *Half Step:* half-stars can be selected (allowing .5 increments).
          - *Continuous:* any point along the star can be selected (allowing very fine gradation, effectively continuous from 0 up to the max).
      (Note: Respondents can select “0” stars by either not moving the slider off the starting position or, if Continuous, clicking at the extreme low end.)
2. **Settings & Features**
    - **Statements:** You can add multiple rows (statements/questions) to a single slider question if you want to capture several ratings in one go. Each statement will have an independent slider. (For example, rating “Quality”, “Value”, and “Service” could be three statements with sliders on a 0–10 scale.)
    - **Scale Range (Min, Max, Decimals):** By default, sliders often start at 0 and end at 100 (or 5 for stars). You can set the Minimum value and Maximum value for the slider’s scale. You can also define the number of decimal places allowed (e.g., 0 decimals for whole numbers only, or 1–2 decimals for finer precision).
    - **Increments and Grid Lines:** You can specify the number of increments (grid steps) on the slider. For example, if your scale is 0 to 100 and you set 10 increments, there will be marks at 0, 10, 20, ... 100. You can also enable **Snap to Increments**, which forces the slider handle to jump to the nearest increment mark (e.g., only multiples of 10 in this case). Without snap, the slider can stop at any value and will report potentially many unique values (especially if decimals are allowed). *Tip:* Enabling Snap to Increments simplifies data by limiting unique values and, in the Reports, changes the visualization to show a distribution of picks per value rather than just an average.
    - **Default Position:** By default sliders start at the minimum value (or in the middle for some themes). If you want a custom start, you can set a **Default Choice** (pre-set a starting value). Be aware if a default is set and the respondent doesn’t touch that slider, that default will count as their answer.
    - **Not Applicable Option:** You can add a “Not Applicable” checkbox for each slider (appears as a column on the right of the slider bar). If a respondent checks N/A for a particular row, they can skip that slider. When N/A is checked, that slider’s value is recorded as no value (blank) and is treated as if the question was not answered for that statement. You can customize the label of the N/A column if needed.
    - **Labels:** You may add descriptive labels above the scale points. For example, on a 0–100 slider you might label 0 as “Low” and 100 as “High” or add intermediate labels like “Average” at 50. Under *Format -> Add labels*, you choose how many labels to display and then enter the text for each (Qualtrics can also suggest labels for common scales).
    - **Show Value:** There’s an option to display the numeric value as the respondent moves the slider. If enabled, when the user drags the slider, a number will appear (either in a bubble by the handle or to the side, depending on theme) showing the current value. This can help respondents know the exact number they’ve chosen.
    - **Mobile Friendly:** Sliders can be toggled to a mobile-friendly mode (often automatically active). In mobile friendly mode, if the slider question doesn’t fit on smaller screens, Qualtrics might adjust it (e.g., stacking sliders vertically or turning them into a different input that’s easier to use on touch screens). Ensuring “Mobile Friendly” is checked will try to optimize slider interactions on phones (for example, turning them into a touch-friendly format).
    - **Validation (Response Requirements):** If you enable Force Response on a slider question, respondents must move each slider (for each statement) off the default to proceed. (Qualtrics considers a slider unanswered if left at its starting position, even if that starting position is not the min – unless N/A is checked for that row.) You can also use Request Response which simply warns but allows proceeding. There isn’t a built-in numeric validation (like range enforcement) since you set the min/max on the slider itself.
    - **Randomization:** While typically the order of sliders (statements) is presented as entered, you can randomize the order of the statements (rows) if desired (via Choice Randomization settings, treating each statement as a “choice” in this context).
3. **Data Export Schema**
    - **CSV Column Header Format:** Each slider question generates one column per slider handle. If you have multiple statements (rows), each statement’s data is in its own column. The column header will usually be the question text followed by the statement text (e.g., “How much do you spend on X? – Entertainment” for a slider about spending on Entertainment). If it’s a single slider only, it will just be one column with the question text as header.
    - **Data Values:** The value recorded is the numeric value the respondent selected on the slider. This will be a number between your defined minimum and maximum. For instance, if a slider was 0 to 10 and the respondent dragged to 7, the data value is 7. If you allowed decimal precision, the value could include a decimal (e.g., 7.5). If a slider was not touched and had no forced response, it might be blank (no data) for that respondent. If “Not Applicable” was checked for a slider row, that row’s value is stored as blank (null) in the dataset (since the instruction is to treat it as not answered). In a stars interaction, the selected number of stars is stored (e.g., 4 out of 5 stars would just be 4 in the data, or 4.5 if half-stars were allowed and chosen).
    - **Recode Values:** Sliders inherently produce a numeric value within a range, so there isn’t a separate “recode” mapping for the slider positions – the number itself is the value. (You define the range rather than define labels that recode.) If you use labels on the slider, those labels do not change the underlying values; they are for display only. For example, labeling 0 as “Very Cold” and 100 as “Very Hot” doesn’t change that the data will be 0 and 100. Internally, Qualtrics uses the numeric value for calculations (and in Scorecards, slider questions are considered numeric). Thus, there’s typically no manual recoding needed or available for slider scales, except changing the min/max if you want a different numeric range. One exception: if you use the slider in a Scoring category (Quiz scoring), Qualtrics uses a “multiplier” approach to convert slider positions to scores, but that is separate from the recorded response value.
